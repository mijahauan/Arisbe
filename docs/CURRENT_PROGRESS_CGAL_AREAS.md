# Current Progress: CGAL-Based Area Management System

## Status: Plan Update System Broken
- Windsurf's plan update system is failing with "planner failed to generate any edits to the plan" errors
- This manual document captures recent critical progress not reflected in plan.md

## Major Breakthrough: Area-Based Spatial Modeling

### Problem Identified
- Visual rendering issues stem from lack of precise area boundary awareness
- Need exact correspondence between Dau's logical areas and visual boundaries
- Current system lacks constraint-based positioning within areas

### Solution Architecture: CGAL-Based Area Management

#### Core Concept
- **Logical areas** (from EGI) map to **visual areas** (bounded by cuts)
- **Movement within areas is arbitrary to logic** - enables visual optimization
- **Area boundaries are immutable** - preserves logical structure

#### Why CGAL?
- **Exact arithmetic** - no floating-point precision errors
- **Robust edge case handling** - touching boundaries, degenerate cuts, complex intersections
- **Proven reliability** - academic/industrial computational geometry standard

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: CGAL Integration
- [ ] Install CGAL Python bindings
- [ ] Create CGALAreaManager class
- [ ] Implement exact polygon operations for area subtraction
- [ ] Handle cut hierarchy with precise boundary management

#### Phase 2: Area-Aware EGDF Generation
- [ ] Replace current positioning with area-constrained optimization
- [ ] Ensure elements stay within assigned logical areas
- [ ] Optimize visual positioning within area constraints
- [ ] Maintain 1.5px ligature clearance and visual separation

#### Phase 3: Interactive Constraints
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop with area boundary enforcement
- [ ] Real-time constraint validation for user interactions
- [ ] Visual feedback for constraint violations

### Critical Requirements
- **Exact area boundaries** - cuts define precise available space
- **Hierarchical area model** - sheet → cuts → sub-cuts with exact geometry
- **Constraint enforcement** - impossible to violate area boundaries
- **Visual optimization** - elements positioned optimally within constraints

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Fix plan update system (if possible)
2. Install and test CGAL Python bindings
3. Implement basic area hierarchy with exact geometry
4. Test with Roberts Disjunction and nested quantifier examples

## Current Visual Issues Being Addressed
- Heavy line spacing (wide gaps at predicate boundaries)
- Line separation (continuous appearance of separate identity lines)
- Vertex positioning (respecting logical areas while optimizing visually)

## Architecture Decision: CGAL Over Shapely
- CGAL: Exact arithmetic, robust edge cases, proven reliability
- Shapely: Floating-point errors, edge case issues, less robust
- Custom: Too many edge cases to handle manually
