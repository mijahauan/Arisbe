The research ﬁeld of diagrammatic reasoning investigates all forms of human
reasoning and argumentation wherever diagrams are involved. This research
area is constituted from multiple disciplines, including cognitive science and
psychology as well as computer science, artiﬁcial intelligence, logic and mathematics. But it should not be overlooked that there has been until today a
long-standing prejudice against non-symbolic representation in mathematics
and logic. Without doubt diagrams are often used in mathematical reasoning,
but usually only as illustrations or thought aids. Diagrams, many mathematicians say, are not rigorous enough to be used in a proof, or may even mislead
... it is dispensable as a proof-theoretic device; indeed ... it has no
proper place in a proof as such. For the proof is a syntactic object
consisting only of sentences arranged in a ﬁnite and inspectable area.
Nonetheless, there exist some diagrammatic systems which were designed for
mathematical reasoning. Well-known examples are Euler circles and Venn diagrams. More important to us, at the dawn of modern logic, two diagrammatic
systems had been invented in order to formalize logic. The ﬁrst system is
Frege’s Begriﬀsschrift, where Frege attempted to provide a formal universal
Sanders Peirce, which he used to study and describe logical argumentation.
But none of these systems is used in contemporary mathematical logic. In contrast: For more than a century, linear symbolic representation systems (i.e.,
formal languages which are composed of signs which are a priori meaningless,
and which are therefore manipulated by means of purely formal rules) have
been the exclusive subject for formal logic. There are only a few logicians who
have done research on formal, but non-symbolic logic. The most important
ones are without doubt Barwise and Etchemendy. They say that
there is no principle distinction between inference formalisms that use
text and those that use diagrams. One can have rigorous, logically
sound (and complete) formal systems based on diagrams.
Barwise and Etchemendy 1994, quotation adopted from [Shi02a]
This treatise advocates this view that rigor formal logic can be carried out
by means of manipulating diagrams. In order to do this, the systems of existential graphs is elaborated in a manner which suits the needs and rigor of
contemporary mathematics.
There are good reasons for choosing Peirce’s EGs for the purpose of this
treatise. Peirce had been a philosopher and mathematician who devoted his
life to the investigation of reasoning and the growth of knowledge. He was
particularly interested in the exploration of mathematical reasoning, and EGs
are designed as an instrument for the investigation of such reasoning.
Before he invented EGs at the end of the 19th century, Peirce contributed
Thus, Peirce was very familiar with both approaches –the diagrammatic and
the symbolic– to logic. As he was interested in an instrument for the investigation of logic (which has to be distinguished from the investigation and
and disadvantages, of these two approaches to a large extent. Particularly, he
elaborated a comprehensive theory of what he already called diagrammatic
reasoning, and he considered his diagrammatic system of EGs to be far more
perfect for the investigation of mathematical reasoning than the symbolic approach he developed as well. His philosophical considerations, his arguments
for his preference of the diagrammatic approach to logic, will give us valuable
and Gamma. These parts presuppose and are built upon each other, i.e.
Beta builds upon Alpha, and Gamma builds upon Alpha and Beta. As EGs
are an instrument for the investigation of mathematical reasoning, it is not
surprising that the diﬀerent parts of EGs correspond to speciﬁc fragments of
mathematical logic. It is well accepted that Alpha corresponds to propositional
logic, and Beta corresponds to ﬁrst-order predicate logic.2 The part Gamma
1 For example, he invented, independently from Frege, together with his student
O. H. Mitchell a notation for existential and universal quantiﬁcation. According
to Putnam [Put82], Frege discovered the quantiﬁer four years before Mitchell, but
priority; but Peirce and his students discovered it in the eﬀective sense.’

1.1 The Purpose and the Structure of this Treatise
is more complicated: It contains features of higher order and modal logic, the
possibilty to express self-reference, and other features. Due to its complexity, it
was not completed by Peirce. The majority of works which deal with Gamma
deal only with the fragment of Gamma which corresponds to modal logic.
The formal mathematical logic we use nowadays emerged at the beginning
of the 20th century. Russell’s and Whitehead’s
landmark work Principia
published in the years 1910–1912. It is obvious that Peirce’s works can by no
means satisfy the needs and criteria of present mathematical logic. His contributions to symbolic logic found their place in the development of modern
formal logic, but his system of EGs received no attention during this process.
Thus, in order to prove mathematically that Alpha and Beta correspond to
propositional and ﬁrst order predicate logic, respectively, the system of EGs
has ﬁrst to be be reworked and reformulated as a precise theory of mathematical logic. Then the correspondence to the symbolic logic we use nowadays
can be mathematically formulated and proven.
