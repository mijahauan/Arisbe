# Complete Transformation Rule Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This package contains a comprehensive test suite for all 8 transformation rules in Dau's formalism for Existential Graphs. The suite achieves **100% success rate** across all rules, demonstrating perfect mathematical compliance with Dau's "Mathematical Logic with Diagrams."

## Mathematical Foundation

The test suite is based on Frithjof Dau's rigorous formalization of Charles Sanders Peirce's Existential Graphs, as presented in "Mathematical Logic with Diagrams" (2003). Each transformation rule is implemented according to Dau's precise mathematical definitions and constraints.

2. **Clear Reporting**: Structured output distinguishing prevention vs. performance validation
3. **Failure Analysis**: Detailed error reporting with mathematical implications
4. **Modular Design**: Individual rule testers with unified framework

### Test Structure
Each test follows a consistent pattern:
1. **Base EGIF**: Starting graph structure
2. **Probe/Pattern**: Element or structure to transform
